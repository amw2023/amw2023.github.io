					The AMW Summer School is a two day event (May 23 - 23) preceding the Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management 2023. 
					The event consists of multiple tutorials aimed at a mixed audience of students and other interested attendees. </p>
					<h3>Our goals</h3>
				    <ul>
				        <li>Host tutorials targeted at students (advanced undergraduate or postgraduate level) or other early term researchers interested in the area of Data Management;
						</li>
						<li>Provide a venue where young Latin American students and researchers can meet, discuss, learn, and seek feedback on their research topics, thus reinforcing research networks (of the future) in the area.
						</li>
				    </ul>

									<h4>Explanations in Data Management and Artificial Intelligence</h4>
									<p>
                                        ExplainableAI is one of the most active areas of research in AI and machine learning in these
                                        days. In this tutorial we will review some recent approaches to providing explanations in data management, knowledge representation and machine learning. In particular, causality-based approaches, model-based diagnosis, and score-based explanations will be described and applied to query answering and consistency assessment in databases, and outcomes of classification models.

									<h4>Tutorial title (TBA)</h4>
									<p>
                                        Uncertain and imprecise data occur more and more often in today’s information systems, and
                                        can arise for different reasons, including integrating data originating from different sources. This phenomenon is widely recognized nowadays, to the point that it has been included, with the name of "Veracity", as one of the 4 V’s of Big Data (the others being Volume, Velocity and Variety). Dealing with such kind of data poses different challenges, and a fundamental one is obtaining meaningful answers to our queries. The goal of this tutorial is to discuss the notion of inconsistent data, the challenges that these kind of data arise, and approaches to deal with such issues, with a particular focus on query answering. We will first overview the classical Consistent Query Answering (CQA) approach, by introducing the framework and some fundamental results. We will then identify some of the limitations of classical CQA, and discuss how one can overcome them, by means of more refined approaches. We will see that obtaining refined query answers comes at price, as the complexity of query answering increases, in general, w.r.t. classical CQA. Thus, we will discuss how query answers can be approximately computed under the new frameworks, by means of efficient approximation algorithms.

									<h4>Natural Language Interfaces to Databases</h4>
									<p>
									Users need to learn and master a complex query language like SQL or SPARQL to access to data in knowledge and databases. Another and more natural way to query the data is using natural language interfaces to explore the data. The main challenge in natural language based querying of data is to identify user intent. To interpret the user's natural language query, many systems try to identify the entities in the query and the relationships between them. There are many entity-based solutions in the literature, with varying complexity of the queries that they can generate. Recently, machine learning and deep learning based techniques have also become popular. In this tutorial, we will review state-of-the-art natural language interface solutions in terms of their interpretation approach, as well as the complexity of the queries they can generate.

									<h4>Vectorial Representation of Words based on Neural Networks</h4>
									<p>
                                        Word Embeddings (WE) are vectorial representation of words in a low dimensional space. WE are usually constructed by training Neural Networks from huge text corpora and have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing. In this tutorial we will survey the main methods for constructing WE as well as some applications for text classification. We will also present code and pretrained WE models in the Spanish language that the audience can later use for their own applications. Finally we will discuss on new ways of constructing WE contextualized with a now very famous model called BERT. BERT code and models in Spanish will also be presented in the tutorial.

					<h3>VLDB Student Travel Grants</h3>
					
					<p>
					Thanks to the generous support of the VLDB Endowment, we have travel grants available to offer students attending the AMW school and workshop. All students wanting to participate are encouraged to apply, however, preference will be given to students registered in a Latin American university. Grants will have a maximum value of US$1,500 to help cover flight, accommodation and registration in the main workshop. These grants will be awarded in cash at the event.
					</p>
					<p>
					If you are a student (undergrad or postgrad) attending the AMW school and workshop, and would like to receive travel support, please send an email to the AMW school chairs (Jarek Szlichta - jarek@szlichta.com and Domagoj Vrgoč - domagojvrgoc@gmail.com) stating why you would like to attend the school and how much support you would need.
					</p>
					<p>
					Please also CC your supervisor (or a professor in your department), and attach a short 1-page CV (including at least: name, address, universities attended, degrees achieved/in-progress, current position; and if applicable: theses and/or publications authored, supervisor, relevant professional experience, other important merits, etc.). In case you have a paper in the AMW workshop, please provide us with details of this in your email.
					</p>
					<p>
					We will then select those students who we feel stand to gain the most from the experience of attending the school.

					</p>
					<p>
					The students selected for the travel grants are expected to prepare a poster to be presented during the evening sessions of the school and the workshop.
					</p>
					<p>
					Deadline: April 11th </br>
					Notification: April 13th.
