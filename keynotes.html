									<h4>SQL/PGQ: a systems perspective</h4>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b> The main topic the talk is SQL/PGQ, the new sub-language introduced in SQL:2023 for Property Graph Queries. The talk will cover the history of SQL/PGQ as well as give a short introduction of the syntax and semantics of this language.  The talk will touch upon some research challenges posed by SQL/PGQ in database architecture (which is my home area), but also in graph algorithms and their complexity. The talk will also give an update of our effort to implement SQL/PGQ in a real system: namely as an extension module that will add PGQ support to <a href="http://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a>. This system, that was developed in my group at CWI, is becoming popular for data engineering and data science and I will also talk about opportunities to integrate PGQ and graph database technology in use cases such as Graph Neural Network training and scoring. </p>

                                    <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/">Peter Boncz</a> holds appointments as tenured researcher at CWI and professor at VU University Amsterdam. His academic background is in database systems, with the open-source column-store MonetDB the outcome of his PhD. He also architected Vectorwise, the system that pioneered vectorized query execution. He co-created and still chairs the non-profit organization Linked Database Benchmark Council (<a href="http://ldbcouncil.org">LDBC</a>) that aims at maturing graph database technology through benchmarks and more.  He has been involved in six database startups to date, and advises both Databricks ("Spark in the cloud") and DuckDB Labs (the new startup around DuckDB founded by CWI colleagues Hannes Mühleisen and Mark Raasveldt). He is currently on sabbatical at young startup MotherDuck.

									<h4>The Quest for Schemas in Graph Databases</h4>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b> Property graphs are a widespread data model for representing interconnected multi-labeled data enhanced with properties as key/value pairs. These highly expressive graphs are used in a wide range of domains, such as social and transportation networks, biological networks, finance, cybersecurity, logistics and planning, to name a few. Property graphs are the building blocks of future graph ecosystems, in which OLTP and OLAP processes are intertwined with complex advanced processes, such as learning, scientific computing and business intelligence. <br/>
									While property graphs are currently used in a variety of graph databases, a rather fragmented landscape emerges in terms of the supported query and schema languages. In particular, the coverage of schema and constraints is limited if not completely lacking in these systems. In this talk, I will present recent advances in terms of schemas and constraints for property graphs, as part of our work within the LDBC community groups. I will also focus on graph schema discovery and constraint satisfaction following these proposals for property graph schema and constraints. Finally, I will pinpoint future directions of research in this new exciting area of data management. </p>

									<h4>AI is Reducing to Data Curation</h4>
									<p>AI advances have been concentrated in curation-on-read settings: LLMs are trained on massive, weakly curated convenience samples of the internet, while the output is assumed to be subject to careful human review and accountability on a per-instance basis. This regime shifts all responsibility to the end user to identify errors, biases, and compliance issues (e.g., intellectual property violations).<br/>
									There do exist successful AI applications in curation-on-write settings, typically in science: models trained on precise, objectively correct input in order to produce precise, objectively correct output.   For example, popular deep learning architectures are poised to outperform physics-based models to predict the weather, simultaneously learning the physics and the parameters directly from observations, without requiring fluid dynamics to be explicitly programmed.<br/>
									We are studying enabling technologies to reduce the cost of developing AI systems in these curation-on-write settings, characterized by limited data, complex multi-modal features, and ambiguous or conflicting labels.   As methods continue to be commoditized, costs are driven by finding and organizing training and evaluation data.  This perspective of “curation as programming” is an opportunity to design new tooling to empower domain experts to build AI systems for specialized tasks.<br/>
									I’ll describe some projects my group is pursuing in this space including recovering missing data in urban mobility, identifying speakers and agenda items in local council meetings, and extracting information from legal documents.  I’ll describe the technical questions we encounter in these settings, including how best to use expert-provided ontologies and unlearning specific biases during fine-tuning. </p>
