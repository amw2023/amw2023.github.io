						<h3>About Perú and Cusco</h3>

    					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru">Perú</a> is located in the western and central part of 
    					   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a>. 
    				        It is the third largest country in South America and one of the 20 largest countries in the world.
    				        Peru's culture is one and many at the same time. The Incas forged an incredible civilization that 
    				        learned how to tame the geography of Peru. 
    				        Part of this ancient society still lives today in each town and can be seen 
    				        through the customs of the people.
    				        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima">Lima</a> is the capital and the largest city of Peru.

                            Modern-day Peruvians are heirs to traditions of civilizations that flourished for centuries before 
    				        the arrival of the Europeans. 
                            The resulting cultural blend was further enhanced by African and Asian contributions, 
    				        which also took root in this land.

    							beautiful beaches, wondrous nature reserves, and the vibrant nightlife, give Peru’s capital 
    							an authentic and unique personality. Lima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher 
    							learning in the New World. The National University of San Marcos, founded on 12 May 1551, is the

    							Its Quechua name, Qosqo, means "navel of the world", because the city was the center that controlled
